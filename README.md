================================

A simple workflow for searching CocoaPods.

**How to use it**

- [Download](https://github.com/alladinian/Alfred-CocoaPods-Search/raw/master/CocoaPods.alfredworkflow) the workflow directly from GitHub (or clone the repo / download a zip) & double-click the `CocoaPods.alfredworkflow` file to install it into Alfred.
- Bring Alfred up and type `pod` followed by your query.
- Once you have a result selected Return opens the pod's homepage & Alt+Return copies the pod's definition for your `podfile`.

Enjoy!

**Notes:**

- The backend utility is now a binary written in pure Cocoa (instead of a python script). The result is that is wayyy faster and smaller than the previous version.
- The workflow uses the [Cocoapods.org public search API](http://blog.cocoapods.org/Search-API-Version-1/). Many thanks to [@floere](https://github.com/floere) for his work, tips & heads up.
